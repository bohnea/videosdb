##Project overview
***

This project simulates a *database* that keeps track of *videos*, *actors*, *users* and *actions* that can be performed
on the database.
There are three types of actions: *command*, *query* and *recommendation*. Commands can modify the entities stored in
the database, while queries and recommendations can only retrieve information and process it.
Each individual component, along with the general design and the links between entities, will be detailed in the
following sections.

## Additional remarks
***

A few java features used in the creation of this project were new to me, so I would love some feedback on their design
(alongside feedback on the general design of the project - package structure, dependencies, possible design patterns
etc.)

Some examples of java features include:
 * the complicated database object in the class with the same name (not even sure if that was a good idea, but it was 
a great challenge)
 * the exceptions used as error codes for the commands
